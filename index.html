          Let me make one thing clear first. If you are a beginner programmer, this article is not meant to make you feel bad
          about the mistakes that you might be making but rather to make you aware of them, teach you to spot signs of them, and
          remind you to avoid them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have made these mistakes in the past and learned from each and every one of them. I am happy to have formed coding
          habits to help me avoid them. You should do too.
        </p>
        <p>
          These mistakes are not presented here in any particular order.

        <h2>1) Writing Code Without Planning</h2>
        <p>
          High-quality written content, in general, cannot be created easily. It requires careful thinking and research.
          High-quality programs are no exception.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing quality programs is a process with a flow:
          Think. Research. Plan. Write. Validate. Modify.
          Unfortunately, there is no good acronym for this. You need to create a habit to always go through the right amount of
          these activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the biggest mistakes I have made as a beginner programmer was to start writing code right away without much
          thinking and researching. While this might work for a small stand-alone application, it has a big, negative effect on
          larger applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like you need to think before saying anything you might regret, you need to think before you code anything you
          might regret. Coding is also a way to communicate your thoughts.

        <p class="quotationFont"><q>When angry, count to 10 before you speak. If very<br> angry, a hundred.<br>
        — Thomas Jefferson.</q></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Here is my version of that quote:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="quotationFont"><q>
          When reviewing code, count to 10 before you<br> refactor a line. If the code does not have tests, a<br> hundred.<br>

        </q>

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Programming is mostly about reading previous code, researching what is needed and how it fits within the current system,
        and planning the writing of features with small, testable increments. The actual writing of lines of code is probably
        only 10% of the whole process.</p>
        <p>Do not think about programming as writing lines of code. Programming is a logic-based creativity that needs nurturing.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>2) Planning Too Much Before Writing Code</h2> 
        <p>Yes. Planning before jumping into writing code is a good thing, but even good things can hurt you when you do too much
        of them. Too much water might poison you.</p>
        <p>Do not look for a perfect plan. That does not exist in the world of programming. Look for a good-enough plan, something
        that you can use to get started. The truth is, your plan will change, but what it was good for is to force you into some
        structure that leads to more clarity in your code. Too much planning is simply a waste of your time.</p>
        <p>I am only talking about planning small features. Planning all the features at once should simply be outlawed! It is what
        we call the<strong>Waterfall Approach</strong> , which is a system linear plan with distinct steps that are to be finished one by one.
        You can imagine how much planning that approach needs. This is not the kind of planning I am talking about here. The
        waterfall approach does not work for most software projects. Anything complicated can only be implemented with agile
        adaptations to reality.</p>
        <p>Writing programs has to be a responsive activity. You will add features you would never have thought of in a waterfall
        plan. You will remove features because of reasons you would never have considered in a waterfall plan. You need to fix
        bugs and adapt to changes. You need to be agile.</p>
        <p>However, always plan your next few features. Do that very carefully because too little planning and too much planning
        can both hurt the quality of your code, and the quality of your code is not something you can risk.</p>

      <div>
        <h2>3) Underestimating the Importance of Code Quality</h2>
        <p>If you can only focus on one aspect of the code that you write, it should be its <strong>readability</strong>. Unclear code is trash. It
        is not even recyclable.</p>
        <p>Never underestimate the importance of code quality. Look at coding as a way to communicate implementations. Your main
        job as a coder is to clearly communicate the implementations of any solutions that you are working on.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite quotes about programming is:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="quotationFont"><q>Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining<br> your code will be a violent psychopath who knows<br> where you live.<br>
        — John Woods</q></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Brilliant advice, John!</strong></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Even the small things matter. For example, if you are not consistent with your indentation and capitalization, you
        should simply lose your license to code.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="blocks">tHIS is<br>
        WAY MORE important<br>
        than<br>
        you think</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Another simple thing is the use of long lines. Anything beyond 80 characters is much harder to read. You might be
        tempted to place some long condition on the same line to keep an if-statement block more visible. Do not do that. Just
        never go beyond the 80 character limit, ever.</p>
        <p>Many of the simple problems like these can be easily fixed with <strong>linting</strong>and <strong>formatting</strong> tools. In JavaScript, we have two
        excellent tools that work perfectly together: <strong>ESLint</strong> and <strong>Prettier</strong>. Do yourself a favor and always use them.</p>
        <p>Here are a few more mistakes related to code quality:</p>
        <p>— Using many lines in a function or a file. You should always break long code into smaller chunks that can be tested and
        managed separately. I personally think that any function that has more than 10 lines is just too long, but this is just
        a rule of thumb.</p>
        <p>— Using double negatives. Please do not not not do that.</p>
