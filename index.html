          Let me make one thing clear first. If you are a beginner programmer, this article is not meant to make you feel bad
          about the mistakes that you might be making but rather to make you aware of them, teach you to spot signs of them, and
          remind you to avoid them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have made these mistakes in the past and learned from each and every one of them. I am happy to have formed coding
          habits to help me avoid them. You should do too.
        </p>
        <p>
          These mistakes are not presented here in any particular order.

        <h2>1) Writing Code Without Planning</h2>
        <p>
          High-quality written content, in general, cannot be created easily. It requires careful thinking and research.
          High-quality programs are no exception.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing quality programs is a process with a flow:
          Think. Research. Plan. Write. Validate. Modify.
          Unfortunately, there is no good acronym for this. You need to create a habit to always go through the right amount of
          these activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the biggest mistakes I have made as a beginner programmer was to start writing code right away without much
          thinking and researching. While this might work for a small stand-alone application, it has a big, negative effect on
          larger applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like you need to think before saying anything you might regret, you need to think before you code anything you
          might regret. Coding is also a way to communicate your thoughts.

        <p>Programming is mostly about reading previous code, researching what is needed and how it fits within the current system,
        and planning the writing of features with small, testable increments. The actual writing of lines of code is probably
        only 10% of the whole process.</p>
        <p>Do not think about programming as writing lines of code. Programming is a logic-based creativity that needs nurturing.</p>
